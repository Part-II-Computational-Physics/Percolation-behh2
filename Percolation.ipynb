    "Percolation is a simple model in statistical physics that has been well studied. In this report we will...<br> Percolation theory describes the behaviour of _clusters_ in a large lattice of dimension d. The two most studied percolation models are site percolation and bond percolation. In site percolation, the lattice vertices are the relevant quantitities. Each lattice vertex/site is either \"occupied\", with probability $p$, or \"unoccupied\", with probability 1-$p$. A cluster is a group of occupied lattice sites that are connected by a chain o f nearest neigbour links (i.e for every site in a cluster, one of its nearest neigbours is also occupied)[1]. \n",
    "<br><br> Bond percolation is a similar model where the lattice bonds are the relevant quantities. Each bond is either \"open\", with probability $p$, or \"closed\", with probability 1-$p$ [2]. In both models, the probability of a site being occupied/a bond being open is independent of the status of its neighbours. \n",
    "<br><br> Percolation theory has a wide range of uses from modelling resistor networks to ecological disturbances like forest fires. However, it was first used to model the flow of a liquid through porous material. Using a model of bond percolation on a $n$ x $n$ x $n$ lattice we can ask, for given $p$, what is the probability that there exists an \"open\" chain of bonds through the lattice? (i.e will the liquid be able to pass through the material?) "
